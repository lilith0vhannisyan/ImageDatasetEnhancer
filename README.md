## Introduction

**Image Dataset Enhancer** is a Streamlit application designed to augment image datasets by adding noise, specifically **Gaussian Noise** and **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**. This tool is ideal for preparing datasets for machine learning and computer vision tasks, helping to improve model robustness by simulating various real-world distortions.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository (optional but recommended)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or download the ZIP file directly from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageDatasetEnhancer.git
